STASH PROOF – DAY 3

Scenario:
I had uncommitted changes while switching branches.

Steps Performed:

1. Made changes to a file without committing.

2. Stashed the changes:
   git stash

3. Switched to another branch:
   git checkout release/v0.1

4. Verified working directory was clean.

5. Returned to original branch:
   git checkout main

6. Restored the stashed changes:
   git stash pop

Result:
- Changes were safely stored and restored.
- No data loss occurred.
- Branch switching was done cleanly using stash.
