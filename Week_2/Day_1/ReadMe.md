# Semantic HTML — Overview

This file describes what I learned about semantic HTML elements and why they are important when building web pages.

## What is Semantic HTML?
Semantic HTML uses meaningful tags that clearly describe their role in a webpage. These elements help browsers, developers, and accessibility tools understand the structure and purpose of content.

## Why Semantic HTML Matters
- Makes web pages easier to understand and maintain
- Improves accessibility for screen readers and assistive tools
- Helps search engines better index content
- Creates cleaner and more readable code

## Commonly Used Semantic Tags
- **header** – Represents the top section of a page or section, usually containing titles or branding
- **nav** – Holds navigation links for moving through the site
- **main** – Contains the main content of the page (should be used once)
- **section** – Groups related content under a common topic
- **article** – Represents independent content such as a blog post or news article
- **aside** – Used for side information like author info or related content
- **footer** – Appears at the bottom of a page or section with extra information
- **figure & figcaption** – Used to display images with captions
- **details & summary** – Provides expandable content sections
- **address** – Displays contact or author information
- **time & mark** – Used for dates, times, and highlighted text

## Good Practices to Follow
- Choose tags based on meaning, not appearance
- Use only one `main` element per webpage
- Follow a proper heading hierarchy for better structure
- Use semantic landmarks to improve screen reader navigation
- Apply ARIA attributes only when semantic tags are not sufficient

## Conclusion
Using semantic HTML creates well-structured, accessible, and professional web pages that are easier to read and maintain.
